Simulating Card Shuffling Models and Measures

card_shuffling.py contains a class for a deck of cards with the following shuffles implemented:

- Pemantle's Model for the Overhand Shuffle
- Psuedorandom shuffle

It also contains measures of distance away from an unshuffled deck such as:

- RSS (Root-Sum-Square)
- RMS (Root-Mean-Square)

Finally there are functions for plotting a simulated distribution for these measures of distance.
